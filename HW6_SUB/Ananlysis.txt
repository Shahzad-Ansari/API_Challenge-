1) 
	Latitude V Max temp shows a distinct bell curve, as one gets closer to the equaitor the temprature increase. 
	This makes sense, along the equaitor are the hottest regions of our planet; deserts and jungle etc.
2) 	
	Lat V humidity and Lat V Wind Speed are amost inverses of eachother, this stands to reason Places with 
	high wind speeds would not be humid. Youll notice that many of these places have low wind speeds and thus
	it follows that many of these places have a high humidity. If one were to run a correlation analysis 
	it might corroborate this.
3)
	The latitudes that tend to be the most humid are clustered generally along the equaitor, though this 
	isnt always true. This follows the reasoning that the equaitor is generally hotter.
